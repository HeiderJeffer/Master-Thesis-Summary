## Abstract

This research explores the disproportionately high failure rate of hardware startups compared to their software counterparts. Using an exploratory, qualitative approach grounded in secondary data‚Äîincluding CB Insights reports, blogs, and founder interviews‚Äîthe study uncovers **17 recurring failure factors**, grouped into five key themes:

1. **Market & Customer Misalignment**
2. **Product & Technical Challenges**
3. **Financial Constraints**
4. **Business Model Flaws**
5. **Legal & Regulatory Barriers**

In addition to its findings, the project contributes an **open-source framework and dataset** hosted in the [Gilgamesh GitHub repository](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Gilgamesh), intended to support future academic and entrepreneurial work in the hardware domain.



## Research Overview

### Objectives

* Identify key failure causes in hardware startups
* Develop a repeatable framework for analyzing secondary data
* Promote open research through public datasets and tools

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gray literature, CB Insights reports, startup postmortems
2. **Thematic Analysis**: Coded and categorized failure factors
3. **Open Access**: All data and tools available in this repository



## Key Findings

### **Thematic Categories & Failure Factors**

**A. Customer & Market**

* No product-market fit
* Poor marketing execution
* Misreading customer needs

**B. Product & Technical**

* Hardware complexity
* Inability to iterate
* Misaligned product strategy

**C. Financial**

* Burnout of capital
* Poor fundraising timing
* Underestimated manufacturing costs

**D. Business Model**

* Weak/no business model
* Over-reliance on single clients
* Unsustainable pricing

**E. Legal & Regulatory**

* IP and patent issues
* Certification failures
* Regulatory compliance gaps



## Discussion

Hardware startups face **unique challenges**: long development cycles, manufacturing risks, and heavy upfront costs. These are rarely addressed by mainstream entrepreneurial frameworks. By systematically synthesizing gray literature, this work provides actionable insights and a **replicable research method** that can be expanded or adapted in future studies.



## Limitations

* Biases in self-reported postmortems
* Western-centric data
* Qualitative‚Äînot statistically generalizable



## Contributions

* A categorized taxonomy of failure causes
* Methodological blueprint for qualitative research
* Open-access dataset and coding framework
* Practical insights for founders and investors



## Future Work

* NLP-enhanced data mining
* Inclusion of multimedia sources (e.g., podcasts, webinars)
* Comparative case studies
* Collaborations with incubators and VCs for validated data



## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This dissertation offers a foundational, open-access study of why hardware startups fail‚Äîblending academic rigor with practical relevance. It aims to reduce uncertainty in hardware ventures by offering both insights and tools to the broader innovation ecosystem.
